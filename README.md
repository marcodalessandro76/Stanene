# Stanene
GW and BSE analysis of single layer 2d Stanene


TO DO : 

 1) Activate the non linear core correction flag in the HF computation
 2) Increase the the cutoff in the Vxc at the HF level
 3) Repeat the computations up to HF level using pseudo without the NNCC
 4) Test the BSE without the RIM_W
