# Stanene
GW and BSE analysis of single layer 2d Stanene


TO DO : 

 1) Activate the non linear core correction flag in the HF computation : Done. No relevant impact
 
 2) Increase the the cutoff in the Vxc at the HF level : Done. No relevant impact
 
 3) Increase the NGsBlkXp up to 10 Ha with 500 bands to test the cross-correlation
    of these parameters in the convergence analysis of the screening
   
 3) Repeat the computations up to HF level using pseudo without the NNCC 
 
 4) Test the BSE without the RIM_W
